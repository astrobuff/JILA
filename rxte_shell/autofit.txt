brainstorming for the automatic fitting algorithm. There is already a version in fit.xcm that I can base things

1. choose initial fit model and initial estimates

I think it should start with previous fit and do all regular things for pca and then pca+hexte

for pca;

fit
do error on index
do error on tin and norm (if there is diskbb)
do eqw on gauss (if there is gauss)
collect 3. 25. keV flux with error
delete absorption, get unabsorbed flux
if there is diskbb, remove diskbb to get power-law flux only

think about hexte later.

simon vaughan programs at hand 

1. tcl procedure to find minimum of an array
2. shakefit -> this is what I will use, loop over all parameters (until they are fixed) with error and fit to get correct minima

3. main program to do everything, I need to rewrite this.

#### update

programs that take the previous fits and redoing have been written.

#### 

Now the automatization of spectral and temporal extration

A shell program will be faster in execution, but an IDL program is faster for me to write.

ok, challenge, write a shell program

1.input: obsid DONE
2. create directory DONE
3. run pcaextract DONE
4. run hexte_standard+combinepha DONE, need to fix combinepha to handle singl cluster
-an idl program can do next steps faster
4. determine # of gti files DONE
5. determine # of pcu in gti file DONE
6. obtain total time in gti files, multiply them DONE
7. determine the best gti DONE
8. unnecessary pha files and gti files removed DONE
8. determine the ea combination - MANUAL, provide as an input DONE
9. run eaextract in timing mode with the best gti DONE
10. combinelc, combinepha DONE
11. mkdir an DONE
- idl program
12. run syncseg, fourier DONE
13. create spe_hextebinned DONE
IF previous obsid provided
14. cp previous psdfit.pro to an, (to be run manually)
15. cp previous *.xcm to spe_hextebinned
alldo ends here
16. run the correct fit_pca manually
17. if there is hexte, run the correct fit_ph manually
